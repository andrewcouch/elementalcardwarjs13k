These were my notes. Not all feature made it into the game. 






Burnout - When X trump dots have been played, that suit is considered "burned" and may not give out points (though specials still work.

Games end when either all elements have been burned out or all cards played.

Winning a trick gives you points based on the order in the trumps. 


Fire - hot and fast. A lot of points around, so ends up at the top early, but likely to burn out first.
Earth - Steady. Low points, but last to burn out.
Water - Back and forth. Negative points?, reduce burnout chance.
Air- ?

Special Abilities:
	Damage - discard cards
	Lockout - can't play same suit
	Mind wipe - Return X cards to draw deck from hand. (fewer choices, though still draw up to 3 in following turn)
